#Theo the chad
hexaer_theo_main=
[Theo right excited] Heya Madeline!
[Theo right nailedit] I finally finished all of the levels.
[Theo right normal] You can look at the notes I left when you finish the level.
[Theo right yolo] Just approach the light beam.
[Madeline left distracted] Wait a second...
[Madeline left distracted] What is a level?
[Madeline left normal] You mean the different paths?
[Madeline left normal] And even then, how do you manage to get to the end? You can't dash can you?
[Theo right normal] No I don't have any of that {~}trans double jump{/~}.
[Madeline left surprised] But how do you get the {#00FFFF}miniheart{#FFFFFF}?!
[Theo right excited] Come on it's not that hard!
[Madeline sad] But there's spikes and falls everywhere!
[Theo right serious] Madeline...{2} Have you considered going to the left or right of the spikes?
[Madeline left distracted].
[Madeline left distracted].
[Madeline left distracted].
[Madeline left deadpan] Theo,{1} there is forward and backwards.
[Theo right thinking].
[Theo right thinking].
[Theo right thinking].
[Theo right serious] Look at the chapter selection Madeline... It's 3d!
[Theo right excited] You know what?{1} Let's keep it at that. Maybe it's my special thing, just as you have a dash!
[Madeline left surprised] Theo, you're scaring me.

#Level dialogues

[] Greetings, traveler. I shall test thy strength through a gauntlet of your past acomplishments, but not without my own creations.
[] Thou shall vanquish these trials as the only way to obtain the {#00FFFF}miniheart{#FFFFFF}.
[] Good luck.

hexaer_kevin_impressed=
[] I am impressed.
[] Thou swiftly navigated my gauntlet, so you shall be granted access to the {#00FFFF}miniheart{#FFFFFF}.
[] Though I must say before you leave,
[] I will watch you in every level thy explore, for if thou are adventurous enough I will have the joy of meeting thou again.
[] Goodbye,{2} friend...

hexaer_8bwormhole_badeline1= 
[Badeline right scoff] I almost thought you forgot me for a second.
[Madeline left panic] Why does this always happen to me.
[Badeline right normal] Relax, it's going to be just fine!
[Madeline left panic] You say that because you can go through mirrors and stuff.
[Badeline right sigh] Come on we've been through this already.
[Badeline right scoff] Tell me when I haven't helped you when you were in trouble.
[Madeline left upset] {!}{big} Farewell...{/!}{/big}
[Badeline right serious] I still helped you in the end, remember?
[Madeline left panic] And even then, we are lost in the middle of nowhere through some magical mirror, which broke, and with no way back to join {#008000}Theo{#FFFFFF}.
[Badeline right concerned] Don't worry, I'll always be by your side.
[Badeline right scoff] Besides, if this can make you move,{1} I know there is a {#00FFFF}miniheart{#FFFFFF} somewhere around here.
[Madeline left surprised] Wait this can get us back to the {#FFA500}lobby{#FFFFFF} with {#008000}Theo{#FFFFFF}.
[Badeline right normal] The {#FFA500}what{#FFFFFF}?
[Madeline left normal] Idk {#008000}Theo{#FFFFFF} says {#FFA500}it{#FFFFFF} teleports to {~}levels{/~}.
[Badeline right normal] Oh ok.
[Badeline right freakA] Then what are we waiting for?
[Madeline togetherZoom] Let's go!

hexaer_8bwormhole_seeker=
[Madeline left surprised] Woah, it looks like those things in the {#FF0000}temple{#FFFFFF}!

hexaer_8bwormhole_seeker2=
[Badeline left freakA] Come on, fight back! Jump on it!

hexaer_8bwormhole_seeker3=
[Madeline left surprised] It's always in front! Does it teleport?

hexaer_8bwormhole_seeker4=
[Badeline left angry] This thing really doesn't want you to leave.

hexaer_8bwormhole_seeker5=
[Badeline worriedAlt] I would recommend not moving, but the {#00FFFF}miniheart{#FFFFFF} is obviously a bit farther.

hexaer_wormhole_ending1=
[Badeline right scoff] See? We made it fine! I was not even worried in the slightest.
[Madeline left deadpan] Yeah sure.{0.5}.{0.5}.
[Madeline left sad] But where is the {#00FFFF}miniheart{#FFFFFF}?
[Badeline right normal] Don't worry I can still sense it nearby.

hexaer_wormhole_ending2=
MADELINE!

hexaer_wormhole_ending3=
[Madeline right surprised] Who is it?
[TheoMirror left nailedit] It's me {#008000}Theo{#FFFFFF}, look at the mirror!

hexaer_wormhole_ending4=
[Madeline right surprised] I can't see you.
[Theomirror left excited] Well I can!
[Madeline right upset] Don't tell me you got yourself stuck in the mirror too...
[Theomirror left normal] No don't worry I'm in the {#FFA500}lobby{#FFFFFF}.
[Theomirror left yolo] And I see you have also found the {#00FFFF}miniheart{#FFFFFF}!
[Madeline right sadder] No, we didn't even manage that...
[Theomirror left wtf] It's in the top right of the room, you should see it from here.
[Theomirror left normal] Maybe it's just hidden for you.
[Madeline right sad] Maybe you're right I'll look.
[Theomirror left yolo] Come back quick I just finished writing the notes!

[] Day 1: The planed crashed in a hidden chasm and a rock slide blocked the exit, unfortunately only a small proportion of the crew survived. We cannot alert the emergency services, so we're going to look for an exit.
[] Day 4: We can hear twisted screams, something is coming and we don't have long, about three days. At least we found furnitures in the hold, so we have a minimum of comfort while the thing is not here.
[] Day 5: After having searched everything in this cave we are convinced that there is no exit, so we are going to dig up to the surface.
[] Day 6: We are starting to see the light, we're almost there. I hope nobody finds this paper, and if you do, don't take your time :{1} run. It knows you're here.

[Madeline left panic] I'm done...
[Badeline right angry] Worst path design I've seen in a while. Who made this crap anyways?
[Madeline left sadder] It was written by {#6a0dad}Hexaer{#FFFFFF} on the construction sign, but does it really matter now?
[Badeline left freakB] I am going to kindly express my feelings to this idiot right now...
[Badeline right sigh] But don't worry I won't leave you alone like that.
[Madeline left sad] What's the point, {#008000}Theo{#FFFFFF} keeps explaining he is through some {~} magical window {/~}.
[Badeline right angry] First step is getting out of here,
[Badeline right serious] And then I can bash his skull.
[Badeline right upset] Thankfully, if he wants to cheat, we can cheat too.
[Madeline left sad] What do you mean?
[Badeline right normal] Come on Madeline, let's fly...

#Finished levels
hexaer_kevinFinished=
[Theo right normal] Welp...
[Theo right wtf] That was certainly one of the levels of all time.
[Theo right thinking] I think you can guess that was the first level of someone.
[Theo right thinking] Definitly not the dude that wrote these dialogues...
[Theo right excited] Anyways, {#6a0dad}Hexaer{#FFFFFF} told me this attempt of a level was deemed the hardest until Forgotten Cliffside arrived.
[Theo right normal] Even if it was a first, I really hope you somewhat enjoyed it.
[Theo right excited] And go back and get that moonberry if you haven't already! Awesome and custom music is ready for you!
[Theo right yolo] Also you better follow {#ffa640}Dadalika{#FFFFFF} on SoundCloud for making these amazing masterpieces.

hexaer_8bwormhole=
[Theo right excited] Wow! Special magic portal!
[Theo right nailedit] Gotta be honest...{0.5}That was really fun!
[Theo right excited] I saw the seeker thing, but it didn't go after me.
[Theo right thinking] I can somehow guess that it went crazy when it saw you.
[Theo right normal] This level is the first implementation of dialogue!
[Theo right nailedit] (TotallyNotRippedFromTheEverestWebsite{n}BecauseTheCoderIsAssAtActuallyCoding)
[Theo right wtf] I really do wonder how the warp mechanic works.
[Theo right normal] {#6a0dad}Hexaer{#FFFFFF} didn't know either, so he just stole the room from core.
[Theo right thinking] Kinda weird it only works with a certain height.

louplink_MEB=
[Theo right wtf] What a hell to navigate...
[Theo right normal] You're lucky you didn't have to face the V1 weird respawns.
[Theo right normal] This will be probably the first and last level of {#008000}Louplink{#FFFFFF} since he doesn't play Celeste much.
[Theo right thinking] Well I know he understands English and he probably is enventually going to read this, {0.5}so let's just say his level design is {0.5}. {0.5}. {0.5}. {~}interesting.{/~}
[Theo right nailedit] He was also to lazy to create an icon so he just took one from the internet.
[Theo right excited] Even if the level is only kinda flawed, {#6a0dad}Hexaer{#FFFFFF} is really grateful that {#008000}Louplink{#FFFFFF} put effort into this.
[Theo right yolo] He even took the time to place the allmighty {#0f056b}Kevin{#FFFFFF} in his level!
[Theo right nailedit] No not the one you use.

dadalika_FCFinished= 
[Theo right yolo] No way! Well done Madeline!!
[Theo right excited] A hard map on the board!
[Theo right normal] It was the hardest map for a while, but never will a map have really the title of the hardest.
[Theo right nailedit] Since, yknow, they make new maps a lot.
[Theo right normal] {#ffa640}Dadalika{#FFFFFF} has quite the talent when making hard maps, and he improved a lot by finishing them without savestates.
[Theo right normal] Usually it's {#6a0dad}Hexaer{#FFFFFF} that checks if the level is possible.
[Theo right excited] Also did you notice the awesome background!
[Theo right thinking] Glad these makeshift devs finally discovered how stylegrounds work.
[Theo right excited] Fun fact : {#ffa640}Dadalika{#FFFFFF} loves to yeet you into spikes with springs!
[Theo right thinking] I hope I won't have to face this when he makes another level, because they surprise me even if I can go around them.

pig_thePit=
[Theo right excited] Wow finally some none edgy moonberry stuff.
[Theo right thinking] Nowadays mapmakers only think about making a super secret moonberry
[Theo right wtf] ...looking at you {#6a0dad}Hexaer{#FFFFFF} and {#ffa640}Dadalika{#FFFFFF}.
[Theo right nailedit] Not to say it wasn't difficult, it still gave me trouble to beat given there's hardly any place to stand on besides the places {#ff8c00}WhenPigFly{#FFFFFF} intended it.
[Theo right excited] Luckily the almighty {#0f056b}Kevin{#FFFFFF} accepted to take me around the place, so I could document everything!
[Theo right normal] I mean there's even a complete room where {#0f056b}Kevin{#FFFFFF} guides you with his mighty {~}high five{/~}
[Theo right nailedit] ... which will crush you against the wall,
[Theo right excited] But at this point it's just a skill issue.
[Theo right normal] .
[Theo right excited] Oh wait, {#ff8c00}WhenPigFly{#FFFFFF} is sending a discord message to {#6a0dad}Hexaer{#FFFFFF}.
[Theo right serious] Oh my f*cking god, he wanted to add a moonberry when I'm writing this message
[Theo right wtf] What does he mean he was "out of budget"..., they're litteraly doing this for free without earning money?!

louplink_planeCrash=
[Theo right excited] Wake up babe, new level just dropped.
[Theo right nailedit] {#008000}Louplink{#FFFFFF} did the unthinkable,
[Theo right excited] Actually showing interest in this fun project!
[Theo right normal] Anyways, it's safe to say he is never gonna make a level again since he left the discord group.
[Theo right thinking] Your probably wondering how I know this,
[Theo right serious] It's the 3d Madeline.
[Theo right normal] I look out the window and I see everything.
[Theo right thinking] Not even Monika or Whiteface could see this far.
[Madeline surprised] What the heck is he talking about!

hexaer_superDifficult=
[Theo right nailedit] What an experience!
[Theo right excited] I can feel the effort in this level, the art, the plot!
[Theo right normal] The scripted fall, the advanced move block stuff.
[Theo right thinking] It does look like it only gets better.
[Theo right normal] {#6a0dad}Hexaer{#FFFFFF} would like to credit {#c597e8}Laly{#FFFFFF} for the awesome art, even if it was just a flower,
[Theo right wtf] And like 94 frames of petals falling.
[Theo right normal] But every single other art comes from {#6a0dad}Hexaer{#FFFFFF} in this level.
[Theo right thinking] Usually he sucks at drawing, but I guess the tilesets and signs are cool.
[Theo right excited] I do hope you did not smash your screen when you fell, because the glorified ending was super cool.

thanks_ending=
[Theo right normal] Finally, we have done everything...
[Theo right nailedit] There's really nothing more to it.
[Theo right thinking] Kinda sad there's no levels to play anymore.
[Theo right normal] I mean you can go back and look for the berries if you want
